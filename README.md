## FullStackOpen

This is my repository for submitting exercises in the online course ["Full Stack Open"](https://fullstackopen.com) by the University of Helsinki.

Part 3 solution for the course is in [this repo](https://github.com/oatlayers/fsopen-part3).

> This course serves as an introduction to modern web application development with JavaScript. The main focus is on building single page applications with ReactJS that use REST APIs built with Node.js. The course also contains a section on GraphQL, a modern alternative to REST APIs.
>
> The course covers testing, configuration and environment management, the use of databases for storing the applicationâ€™s data amongst other things.
